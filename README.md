## Conway's Game of Life


Conway’s Game of Life is a simple simulation that creates artificial “life” on a grid, each cell of which is either alive or not. Each generation (turn), the following rules are applied:

 - Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies.

 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

A _neighbor_ is defined as any adjacent cell, including diagonally adjacent ones.
